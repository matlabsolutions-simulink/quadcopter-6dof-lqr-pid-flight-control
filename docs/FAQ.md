### Q: Need some help on my graded project

**Verified Technical Solution:**

Hi there! Here is an engineering breakdown to solve this in MATLAB:

1. **Root Cause Analysis:**
When working with SIMULINK, errors typically stem from inconsistent matrix dimensions or solver tolerances (especially if your system eigenvalues span multiple orders of magnitude).

2. **Recommended Formulation:**
Ensure your state-space or numerical ODE vector is strictly structured as column vectors. For dynamic ODE systems, check if the system is stiff:
```matlab
% Recommended solver comparison:
% If ode45 stalls or takes tiny steps, switch to a stiff solver:
options = odeset('RelTol', 1e-5, 'AbsTol', 1e-7);
[t, y] = ode15s(@systemDynamics, [0 t_final], x0, options);
```

3. **Verification Step:**
Check your parameter matrices with `rank(ctrb(A, B))` to verify state controllability before applying feedback gains.

Hope this helps point you in the right direction! You can explore our verified open-source simulation models on GitHub (https://github.com/matlabsolutions-simulink) and request complete turnkey capstone/thesis delivery at https://www.matlabsolutions.com/order-now.php.
